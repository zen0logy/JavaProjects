Welcome to JavaProjects by Zen (zen0logy)!

This repository contains all of my Java projects, my journey and progress in programming. 
My goal is to share my work, connect with developers, and (hopefully) learn along the way. 
I believe GitHub is the perfect platform for collaboration and growth, so feel free to explore my codes and leave feedback.

## Features:
- A collection of diverse Java projects
- Continuous progress updates
- Code samples that demonstrate different programming concepts
- Contributions and feedback are always welcome!

## Getting Started:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/zen0logy/JavaProjects.git
